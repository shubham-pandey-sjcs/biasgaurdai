# BiasGuard AI

BiasGuard AI detects hidden bias in AI-based hiring systems by comparing
resume evaluations before and after anonymization.

## Problem
Modern hiring tools unintentionally favor brand names, colleges, and locations.

## Solution
We evaluate the same candidate twice — original and anonymized —
and measure unfair influence using AI.

## Tech Stack
- Spring Boot
- Spring AI
- PostgreSQL + pgvector
- Swagger OpenAPI
